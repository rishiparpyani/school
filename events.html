<p>International Children's Festival of Performing Arts (ICFPA) was started in the year 2000 under the aegis of ambuja Foundation. 
Its main aim was to create an international platform for young people to perform, unite, exchange ideas and explore the medium of dance,
 drama, puppetry and various other genres of performing Arts.We believe that performing arts is a sensitive, creative and liberal medium
 of expression which helps to establish a bond of friendship and cooperation among nations.ICFPA creates events and forums where participants
 from across the globe participate and amalgamate. The festival is not limited to viewing performances; here the focus is interaction,
 improvisation, play and discussion among the participants.The festival has spread its roots far and wide, with more Asian, African 
and European countries joining us year after year. In the year 2004, we had more than 280 performances and 4000 children participating
 in the festival.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to inculcate leadership qualities in youth is through participation in NCC activities. At ambuja,
 we are devoted to impart a sense of nationalism and secular outlook among our students that contributes towards nation building.
 The NCC activities provide a perfect platform to promote camaraderie and resilience, the much needed qualities of a true leader.

<p>It not the classroom learning alone that will suffice the needs and demands of today's youth. For the holistic development of the child,
 extra-curricular activities play a crucial role. Our Social Service Camps serve the dual purpose of experiential learning involving physical
 and mental abilities. The goal is to groom the leaders of tomorrow who can lead by example.</p>
<h6>Experiencial Learning</h6>

<p>At ambuja vidya peeth, we ensure that along with a high calibre of academics our children inculcate winning habits from a young age.
 We do this through various character building activities that strengthen their moral fibre and helps them face the rigors of academia and life.
The ambuja way is defined as KASSM - Knowledge, Attitude, Skills, Social & Moral Values. Values with sound knowledge and the wisdom to use it 
constructively is what provides the differential factor to our students at ambuja. ambuaites  are "Kings and Queens in the Making"ù. 
Our institutions provide a learning environment that is adaptable and flexible, facilitating potential changes in the higher education pattern.
This is done with an objective to support the new academic paradigm that provides learning for students in a manner most suited to them.</p>
